## Key Themes & Topics
You can choose to focus on one of the following industry challenges:

1. **Media and Entertainment**
   - Content discovery and search (e.g., improving recommendation engines)
   - Content creation for ads and marketing (e.g., generative AI for ad copy and creative)
   - Player/viewer feedback (e.g., analyzing sentiment in reviews or social media)

2. **Healthcare**
   - Medical information retrieval, including **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over structured and unstructured data 
   - Efficient analysis of patient or hospital data
   - Building AI tools to improve patient outcomes and reduce administrative overhead
