# Cal Poly Hackathon: AI for a Better Future  
**Co-Sponsored by Avanade and Databricks**  

---

## Overview
Join us at Cal Poly in Los Angeles for an exciting hackathon dedicated to using **Artificial Intelligence** to build solutions for a better future. This event is co-sponsored by **Avanade** and **Databricks**, bringing together students, developers, and problem-solvers to tackle impactful problems in the **Media & Entertainment** and **Healthcare** domains. We’ll provide a **Databricks** workspace where you can collaborate, build, and deploy your AI/ML solutions. 

---

## Theme & Objectives
The main goal of this hackathon is to create innovative AI-driven solutions that improve human life and society at large. You will form teams of up to **5 people** and choose **one** of the following tracks:

1. **Media & Entertainment**  
   - Fake news detection  
   - Content discovery and search  
   - Content creation for ads and marketing  
   - Player feedback  

2. **Healthcare**  
   - Medical information retrieval, including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over structured and unstructured data  

Your solutions **must** be built on the **Databricks Data Intelligence Platform**. Where AI features are needed, use **Databricks Mosaic AI**. All hackathon work should be performed in the **provided Databricks workspace**.

## Getting Started
1. **Form Your Team**  
   - Find up to 4 other like-minded people to team up with (teams of 1–5 participants).
   - Decide on a team name (be creative!).
   - Choose one of the two topics (Media & Entertainment or Healthcare).

2. **Access the Databricks Workspace**  
   - Each team will receive a link to the shared Databricks workspace.
   - Log in using your assigned credentials.
   - Create or select a cluster and environment to begin coding your solution.
   - Familiarize yourself with **Databricks Mosaic AI** for any AI-based feature you plan to develop.

3. **Select Your Dataset(s)**  
   - Below are some **Kaggle datasets** you can use to prototype and test your solution. You’re free to use additional data sources, but these are a good starting point.
